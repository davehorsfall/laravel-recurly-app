Configuration
=============

Applications need some kind of configuration to toggle settings and define other such environment-specific things. Adifa handles the config like other Flask applications, with the `Config`_ class.

.. _Config: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/


Default Configuration
---------------------

The default configuration for Adifa is defined in the ``.env`` file in the `repository root`_, and contains the following values.

::

    SECRET_KEY = 'best-password-here'
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///../instance/adifa.sqlite'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    API_VERSION = 1
    API_PREFIX = '/api'
    API_SERVER = '/'
    DATA_PATH = './instance/'

.. _repository root: https://github.com/haniffalab/sci-adifa/blob/main/.env

Overriding the Configuration
----------------------------

To override the deafult configuration you can either:

* use system environment variables (recommended for production)
* creating a file called ``config.py`` in your ``instance`` folder (recommended for development)

Using environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To override indivisual values in the configuration pass or create a new system environment variable with the same name as the configuration value, 
and assign it the value that is needed. 

Using config.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The instance folder was introduced in Flask 0.8, and is designed to not be under version control and be deployment specific. Itâ€™s the perfect place
to drop things that either change at runtime or configuration files. To override the configuration, create a new file called ``config.py`` in your
``instance`` folder. This file will not be placed under version control. Copy the contents from ``.env`` into your new ``config.py``, and update the 
values as needed.
